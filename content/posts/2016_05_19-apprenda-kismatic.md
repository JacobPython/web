Kismatic is the first acquisition that Apprenda has completed in the company's history. This purchase also marks the first acquisition of a Kubernetes company in the community - a trend that is sure to continue as both the project and its adoption grow.

Apprenda plans on leveraging Kismatic's efforts to aid in the acceleration of its vision of powering the transition to cloud-native applications, and enabling developers to build software quickly and reliably. Kismatic is both a top contributor to the Kubernetes project and is identified by Gartner as one of only three commercial distributions of Kubernetes.

Apprenda, with the help of Kismatic, will be offering their commerical distribution of the container cluster manager with full enterprise support. The support includes plugins for identity management (LDAP/Active Directory), Kerberos encryption and auditing capabilities. SLA offerings for production deployments of Kubernetes will also be available for customers.

In just under two years since the project was made public, [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) has amassed to be in the top 0.01% of all GitHub projects, with almost 800 contributors to date - this places the project in the same league of popularity as the [Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) and [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails). With production users such as Goldman Sachs, SoundCloud, eBay, Verizon, PayPal, Kubernetes is slated to be the defacto platform for next-generation microservice architectures.
