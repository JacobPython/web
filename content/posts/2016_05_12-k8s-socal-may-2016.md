In this post we will be recapping the resurgence of the [Kubernetes SoCal Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/kubernetes-socal/) which took place yesterday evening in Los Angeles, California. 

We will not only cover the highlights from the great talks and conversation that took place, but we want to experiment with the idea of shining the spotlight on the various Kubernetes "chapters" and vibrant communities from around the globe.

# **...And, we're back!**

After a year long hiatus, the [Kubernetes SoCal Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/kubernetes-socal/) was brought back to life in stellar fashion and we wanted to take the time to showcase some of the great content from the locals. If you're interested in doing the same for your local meetup or if you have a topic you're itching to get in the hands of the rest of the community, feel free to [send us a PR](https://github.com/corekube/web/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or contact us on Twitter [@corekube](http://twitter.com/corekube) for assistance!

There was an amazing turnout of ~65 people representing many different companies, including:

 - Amgen
 - Apprenda
 - ATT/DirecTV
 - EMC
 - Google
 - Kismatic
 - NASA JPL
 - Rackspace
 - Riot Games
 - Solinea
 - SpaceX

Last but certainly not least, this meetup would not be possible without the gracious contributions of [ATT/DirecTV](http://www.directv.com/) who provided the venue, and [Apprenda](https://apprenda.com/) who supplied food & beverages for the attendees, so thank you to them!

# **Talks**

The lineup for the talks was as follows:

 - [Joseph Jacks](https://twitter.com/asynchio) ([Kismatic](http://kismatic.com)) - "Kubernetes Update: Momentum and Community"
 - [Vic Iglesias](https://twitter.com/vicnastea) ([Google](http://google.com)) - "Build a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Jenkins and Kubernetes"
 - [Sushaant Mujoo](https://twitter.com/sushaantmujoo) ([Amgen](http://www.amgen.com/)) - "Experiences, challenges & learnings on implementing PaaS in the enterprise"
 - [Luke Heidecke](https://twitter.com/lukeheidecke) ([Solinea](http://solinea.com/)) - "Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster at Scale on OpenStack"


# **Highlights**

 - **"Kubernetes Update: Momentum and Community"**
	 - Multiple, large companies are running Kubernetes in production today - some have 100's of nodes and others even have 1000+ node clusters!
		 - Given that the [recent optimizations](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/03/1000-nodes-and-beyond-updates-to-Kubernetes-performance-and-scalability-in-12.html) to Kubernetes targeted 1000-node clusters, this is the perfect time to reenforce that the 1000-node number is not a hard limit by the cluster, just a target framed around SLA agreements Google offers its customers on GKE; hence, why some organizations are running clusters much larger than 1000 nodes.
	 - 30% of the top contributors are not vendors

 - **"Build a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Jenkins and Kubernetes"**
	 - [Code & Tutorial](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes)
	 - Jenkins has a [plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin) that allows slaves to be provisoned on Docker hosts in Kubernetes
	 - The Jenkins slave containers can build images from within a container to push out to a image repo
	 - Success during rolling updates ultimately falls on monitoring - Prometheus + your metrics exposed via API is key

 - **"Experiences, challenges & learnings on implementing PaaS in the enterprise"**
	 - Enterprise requirements around tech always revolve around budget
	 - Storage is the first resource to go in Amgen's expericence of running Kubernetes cluster
	 - While Kuberenetes handles the legwork of powering the PaaS, many abstract layers were created to make it even simpler for their internal customers
	 - Getting involved in Kubernetes will initially require a small number of folks to wear multiple hats from release management, container image construction, product design & architecture etc.

 - **"Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster at Scale on OpenStack"**
	 - Using Terraform as a provisioning tool for OpenStack, Solinea is able to deploy Kubernetes clusters for customers in ~3 minutes
	 - There is no perfect deployment tool for Kubernetes on OpenStack as each distro of OpenStack ranging from Mirantis, to RedHat to Rackspace differ in the core services & plugins used.
		 - Customization of OpenStack is the ultimate culprit here as no two OpenStack deployments are the same
		 - The more vanilla your OpenStack cluster is, the easier time you'll have not only upgrading OpenStack, but in how you deterministically deploy Kubernetes on top of it
